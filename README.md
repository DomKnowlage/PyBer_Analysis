# PyBer_Challenge
    
   My team has been commissioned by the great people over at PyBer ride share to organzie and analyize ride share data. Our goal is to help the PyBer team discover areas where they are losing their customer base and determine wether or not there are some solutions that can increase customer outreach and overall satisfaction for drivers and clients alike.

## Overview ##
  
  We were given a large list of ride fare data throughout 3 different areas "Urban, Suburban and Rrual". Urban areas dominate the profits, which is no surprise, more population would equal more rides and more money. The Rural areas are lacking in the profits, it all boils down to the population, more people have their own personal vahicle making breaking into the market a bit more difficult. Suburbia lies in the middle, this is an area I believe we can make some gains in, I'll get to my ideas in the conclusion. Another thing we noticed in the data is there's an abundance of drivers in urban areas, this can create a disparity between our drivers and drive the cost down, pun intended, once again I may have a solution for this as well.

## Conclusion ##
   
   In conclusion my team and I have some solutions to offer. One proposal is reducing fare prices in the Suburban areas. I know it sounds contriversial but with lower prices may entice potential customers to use our services instead of opting to take their own car, especially with gas prices rising like they are dropping the fare proces by $3 may help. Drivers will have more customers and still have tips, and we always have the urban profit centers to continue to make money. Now lets look at the Urban areas, we noticed an abundance of drivers and a disproportinate amount of fares, I don't believe this is fair to your drivers. What I suggest is more marketing, maybe a gurilla style campaign where we take to the streets and stir up some drama with the cab companies, take a look at what Uber has done, we just have to do it more descretely. Or we could have a ride pass, like for a monthly fee you get priority access and with each ride pass used the driver gets a gauranteed 20% tip.
